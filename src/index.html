			<div class="about-it">
				<p>Rock-paper-scissors (also known as paper, rock, scissors or paper, scissors, stone) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.</p>
				<p>These shapes are "rock" (a simple fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). A zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes other than a tie: one of the two players wins, and the other player loses.</p>
